- ASM7341_spectralSensitivity.mat: spectral sensitivity functions for the first 10 channels of the "minispect" chip. These values were taken from the spreadsheet "AS7341_Filter_Templates.xlsx" which was supplied by the manufacturer. The values in this table correspond to Figures 18 and 19 of the white paper AMS Datasheet DS000504 "AS7341; 11-Channel Multi-Spectral Digital Sensor; v3-00 â€¢ 2020-Jun-25"
