maxSpectrum measurements made with ND filters placed in a cassette on the optical path. The ND0 maxSpectrum was measured with a blank collar.

The ND5 and ND6 maxSpectrum files were synthesized from measurements made with other ND levels. This is because the PR670 is not able to measure the spectrum at such low light levels.

ND5 — composed of the ND3 and ND2 spectra multiplied
ND6 — composed of the ND4 and ND2 spectra multiplied

These synthesized spectra attenuate near-IR more than seems to be the trend across the actual physical ND filters.
